## Requirements
If you're using Python, we reccomend that you use Python3. You'll need to install the packages `OpenCV` and `OpenCV contrib` module to work with Aruco markers. You can install these using pip:

`pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python`

For more information on how to detect Aruco markers see the folder **Aruco Markers**. You can also take a look at the script `getcorners.py` in the folder **For Matlab Users**.
