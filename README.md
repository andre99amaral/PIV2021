# PIV2021
Repository for useful resources for PIV projects 

Although we encourage you to work with Python, you are free to use something else (Matlab, C++, etc). In folder For Matlab Users you'll find a couple of scripts that will need to work with Aruco markers if you decide to use Matlab.

This repository can also be used to clarify project-related questions, just open a new issue with your questions.
