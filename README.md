# PIV2021
Repository for useful resources for PIV projects 

In folder **Aruco Markers** you'll find a pdf file with some notes on what Aruco markers are and how to use them.

Although we encourage you to work with Python, you are free to use something else (Matlab, C++, etc). In folder **For Matlab Users** you'll find a couple of scripts that will need to work with Aruco markers if you decide to use Matlab.

This repository can also be used to clarify project-related questions, just open a new issue with your questions.
